/**
 * THE TIME DIAL.
 *
 * A fixed needle with the ribbon of stations travelling underneath it, like
 * tuning a radio — not a thumb sliding along a track. The difference matters:
 * a tuner puts "now" at a constant place on screen and moves the world past it,
 * which is the right metaphor for a machine that holds a place and moves through
 * time. It also means the readout never moves, so the year stays readable while
 * you drag.
 *
 * Each station shows its cache state, so the ribbon doubles as a map of what is
 * already generated. Lit stations are instant; dim ones will cost a wait.
